But the application lifecycle starts much earlier – at design time. Uno Platform provides a Figma plugin, which eliminates the timely designer-developer handoff. In addition, the platform now provides a set of non-UI extensions to help jump-start your apps. Lastly, the VS Code extensions allows C# and XAML to use VS Code with IntelliSense-like experience, C# and XAML Hot Reload, and more.\n\nIn this session, you'll learn how you can create applications spanning across multiple platforms and device form factors, all while reusing your existing XAML and C# skills.\n\n15:21 |  Introduction\n15:58 |  What is WhinUIEverywhere\n20:19 |  #WinUIEverywhere\n22:25 |  Every Pixel\n25:11 |  XAML\n25:39 |  Live demo UNO app\n31:54 |  History of \"Universal app development\"\n33:33 |  Licensing\n34:24 |  Sauce code and Library support\n35:58 |  Infragistics Controls for UNO Platform\n36:08 |  Productivity: Toolkit VS Code, Figmia\n36:58 |  Figma\n38:58 |  UNO for Figma\n40:18 |  Figma Demo\n43:01 |  Themes\n43:52 |  Toolkit\n45:16 |  Extensions: Hit the ground running\n47:11 |  Extensions: Navigation\n48:05 |  Extensions:Reactive (MVU-X)\n50:04 |  VS Code tooling integration\n56:22 |  Making it look like the Figma demo app\n07:20 |  Summary\n10:57 |  Q & A\n\n|| Subscribe for more content from SSW TV ||\n\n|| Press like and leave a comment below to let us know how we're doing ||\n\nTwitter ↴\nhttps://twitter.com/ssw_tv\n\nFacebook ↴\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SSW.page\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNick Randolph\n\nNick currently runs Built to Roam which focuses on building rich mobile applications.

Get Figma Assets\nInstall the Uno Platform Plugin for Figma and Download (“Duplicate”) Uno Platform Material Toolkit from Figma community. The file will contain the sample Commerce App.\n\n2. Export XAML\nInside Figma, navigate to “Example App” inside Uno Platform Material Toolkit. Select any one screen, right-click and select “Uno / Figma” plugin, then generate XAML.\n\n3. See XAML in your App\nCopy XAML generated in step 2 and paste inside your Uno Platform App in Visual Studio. Or if you want to skip steps 1 and 2, you can use XAML we generated. \n\nOther Videos:\nWindows UI 3 : To Do App using Uno Platform | Figma to XAML\nhttps://linkopener.co/youtube-video_hub-ffiumb\n\nWindows UI 3 : Uno Platform | Figma to XAML\nhttps://linkopener.co/youtube-videos_2021-pswuqy\n\nWindows UI 3 : Uno Platform | Get Started\nhttps://linkopener.co/youtube-video-home\n\nWindows UI 3: Login App using Uno Platform | Figma to XAML\nhttps://linkopener.co/youtube-videos-lwrjvy\n\n\n#uno-platform #winui  #figma #fluentui  #uidesign   #visualstudio  #xaml  #vectoart",

        "description": "Developing cross-platform applications is complex. Some frameworks allow us to share the business logic, some go further and allow us to share the UI layer, often limited to the lowest common denominator among target platforms.\nBut even then – working with device hardware still requires not only error-prone platform-specific code but also developers familiar with each of the target platforms to maintain it. What if there was a framework, which would allow you write all your code in C# and XAML, with unlimited styling and templating capabilities, and a single API to access device hardware and APIs? And what if you could use this framework to target all mobile and desktop devices and even the web? Meet the Uno Platform - your C#/XAML apps on Windows, Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, and WebAssembly!\n\n\nCheck out our new channel: \nNDC Clips:\n@ndcclips \n\nCheck out more of our featured speakers and talks at\nhttps://ndcconferences.com/\nhttps://ndclondon.com/",
