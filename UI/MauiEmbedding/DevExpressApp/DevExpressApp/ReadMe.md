> [!NOTE]
> The DevExpress .NET MAUI Controls are currently available [free of charge](https://www.devexpress.com/maui/). However, in order to access the NuGet packages you do need to create an account at [DevExpress website](https://www.devexpress.com/MyAccount/Register/?returnUrl=https%3a%2f%2fnuget.devexpress.com%2f%23feed-url).

> Once you have an account with DevExpress, you need to visit the [Your DevExpress NuGet Feed URL](https://nuget.devexpress.com/#feed-url) page to retrieve a NuGet feed that's associated with your account. You can either add this as a NuGet feed in Visual Studio or use a nuget.config file.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <add key="DevExpress Private Feed" value="[your NuGet feed goes here]" />
  </packageSources>
</configuration>
```
