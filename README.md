This repository provides simple to-the-point samples for features of the Uno platform.

# What is the Uno Platform

The Uno Platform is an Universal Windows Platform Bridge to allow UWP based code to run on iOS, Android, and WebAssembly. It provides the full definitions of the UWP Spring Creators Update (17134), and the implementation of growing number parts of the UWP API, such as **Windows.UI.Xaml**, to enable applications to run on these platforms.

Use the UWP tooling from Windows in [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/), such as [Xaml Edit and Continue](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2016/04/06/ui-development-made-easier-with-xaml-edit-continue/) and [C# Edit and Continue](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/how-to-use-edit-and-continue-csharp), build your application as much as possible on Windows, then validate that your application runs on iOS, Android and WebAssembly.
